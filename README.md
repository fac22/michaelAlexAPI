## Ideas

- Uses 2 MTG APIs
  - [MTG API](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/) for card data
  - [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) for card images and prices
- Returns a random card based
- User can input parameters that filter the random card that gets returned
- Single page app
- On mobile, returns an image of the card and below it a text box with the text on the card and the price
- On desktop, can be a side by side single page view

## MVP

- User can enter a set code
- A collection of cards (~15 cards) is returned representing a booster pack from that set
- User can see images of each card in the booster pack
- User can see various bits of information about each card, text on the card, price, etc
- User can sort the cards by this information
