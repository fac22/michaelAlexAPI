# MTG API Notes

## Does it support CORS (cross-origin requests)?

Haven't found any information on this

## Is there a high enough rate limit?

Third-party applications are currently throttled to 5000 requests per hour. That should be enough for randomising cards, etc.

## Is a free API key available?

No API key required

## Are you able to use the API without user authentication (OAuth)?

Yes

## Is good documentation available?

No, the documentation page is not very specific.
